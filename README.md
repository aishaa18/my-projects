📊 Visualizing Housing Market Trends Using Tableau
Exploring Sale Prices and Features Through Interactive Visualizations
📌 Project Overview
This project provides an interactive analysis of housing market trends using Tableau. By exploring features like house age, renovation history, structural details (e.g., bathrooms, bedrooms, floors), and sale prices, the dashboards offer meaningful insights into buyer preferences and market dynamics.

Designed for real estate professionals, analysts, and decision-makers, the project enables users to explore data intuitively, uncover hidden trends, and support strategic market decisions through clear, visual storytelling.

Data cleaning and transformation were carried out using Tableau Prep, and the final dashboards were built in Tableau Desktop/Public, with version control handled via GitHub.
